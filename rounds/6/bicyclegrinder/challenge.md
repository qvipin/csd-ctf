Gotta keep those tools as sharp as your senses.
What is the English translation for the name of the store behind me? (wrap in csd{}, 1 word only -> eg. csd{word})

- If you zoom into the top right corner you'll find the street name `CALLE CRISTO DE LA SENTENCIA`
- Searching for that on Google maps, you'll find it to be located in Cádiz, Spain
- The butchers shop on the street which is also in the picture gives you the exact location and viewing angle
- Going there on street view and turning around the camera, you'll find a store named `Supermercado El Jamón`
- `El Jamòn` means ham in english
